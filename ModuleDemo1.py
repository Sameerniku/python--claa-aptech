 Modules
 -------
 - Modules are used to categorize the Python code into smaller parts.
 
 - A module is simply a Python file, where classes, functions and 
   variables are defined.
- Grouping up of similar type of code into a single file makes it 
  easier to access.
ex:
   Books are divided into several chapters where each chapter
   contains a specific collection of data/information.
 
 - Adv. is reusability of the code.  

- To apply module, first we have to import it into the program.
   syntax:
            import module1, module2, module3, ...... module n
 
- The code for a module normally resides inside the "main.py" file. 
 
 
 
 '''
def add(a,b):
    res = a+b
    print('Inside add() of  ModuleDemo1.py file')
    return res

def fun1():
    print('Another function calling...')
