Dictionary
----------
- Dictionary is an unordered set of key and value pairs.
  It is a container that contains data enclosed within {}
- The pair( key & value) is known as "item", they are separated
  by a colon(:)
- And the  elements are separated by a comma(,)
- Different type of elements can be entered within a dictionary.
  ex:  dict = { 1:'Python', 2: 'Java' , 3 : 'C++' }     
- Dictionary is mutable (changable), but the key must be unique.
- The values are accessed by their keys and can be updated.
- Dictionary is known as Associative array since the key works 
  as index and they are decided by the user.
    syntax:
          <dictionary_name> [key]
     ex: d1 = { 1 : "BBSR" , 2:"Cuttack" , 3:"Puri"}

d1 = {1 : "BBSR" , 2:"Cuttack", 3: "Puri" , 'city':['RKL',1,2,3] ,4:("Hi") }
